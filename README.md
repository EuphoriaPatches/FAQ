## Why does Euphoria Patches need a mod?
[<ins>Complementary's license</ins>](https://github.com/ComplementaryDevelopment/ComplementaryReimagined/blob/main/License.txt) does not allow us to publish our work as we do not have a "noticeably differen[ce] from the Original Pack in multiple common gameplay scenarios that must include daytime overworld visuals, regardless of the setting or variable changes in the Modified Pack and/or the Original Pack". We simply add onto Complementary so we obviously don't fall into the green zone. We have had many conversations about this topic with Emin and came to a mutual agreement to distribute it through a patcher where none of Emin's code gets distributed (and by that not breaking the license) and the user has to have Complementary Shaders installed in order to get our add-on. All parties profit from this method.
## When does Euphoria Patches update?
We actually update the add-on with every dev release Emin releases on [<ins>Patreon</ins>](https://www.patreon.com/emingt), meaning that when he releases the public version, the add-on should come shortly after!
