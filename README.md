## Why does Euphoria Patches need a mod?
[<ins>Complementary's license</ins>](https://github.com/ComplementaryDevelopment/ComplementaryReimagined/blob/main/License.txt) does not allow me to publish Euphoria Patches directly as it does not have a "noticeably differen[ce] from the Original Pack in multiple common gameplay scenarios that must include daytime overworld visuals, regardless of the setting or variable changes in the Modified Pack and/or the Original Pack". I simply add onto Complementary, this would not qualify as an viable edit. A mutual agreement with Emin was made to distribute Euphoria Patches through a patcher where none of Emin's code gets distributed (and by that not breaking the license) and the user has to have Complementary Shaders installed in order to get the add-on. All parties profit from this method.
## When does Euphoria Patches update?
Euphoria Patches Updates Immediately after a new Complementary Version is out. This includes dev versions. Euphoria Patches dev versions are available on **[Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/spaceagle17)** or **[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/SpacEagle17)**!
